## Usage

Notes:

- For image API, make account at cloudinary.com & get API keys from account dashboard.
- For upload preset usage, if you want to organize images separately at cloudinary.com, you have to create it from account settings first. If you don't want to, just don't put anything or use .env key - `UPLOAD_PRESET`.

#### Env variable:

Create .env file in server directory and add the following:

```
MONGODB_URI = "Your Mongo URI"
PORT = 3005
SECRET = "Your JWT secret"
CLOUDINARY_NAME = "From your cloudinary dashboard"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = "From your cloudinary dashboard"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = "From your cloudinary dashboard"
UPLOAD_PRESET = "Folder/preset name from your cloudinary account" (OPTIONAL)
```

#### Client:

Open client/src/backendUrl.js & change "backend" variable to `"http://localhost:3005"`

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

#### Server:

Note: Make sure that you have installed 'nodemon' as global package.

```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
